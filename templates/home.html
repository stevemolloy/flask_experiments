    <p class="lead">This is an experiment to see if it is feasible to offer design tools for accelerator
    physics online.  That is, to build a website that allows users to design and model charged particle
    accelerators, with all of the computation done server-side.</p>

    <p class="lead">Given the scale of modern accelerators, and the ever increasing computational complexity of modelling codes,
    this would seem to be worse than ridiculous.  Traditionally the hunt has been for access to massively increased
    computational horse-power -- multi-core hyperthreaded beasts, and enormous server farms.</p>

    <p class="lead">We believe this to be misguided.</p>

    <p class="lead">While machines at the leading edge of the state-of-the-art may well need such careful analysis,
    most machines can be designed and constructed using much more modest amounts of computational power.</p>

    <p class="lead">In other words, we intend to demonstrate that accelerator codes can now be deployed online.</p>
